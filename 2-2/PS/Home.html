            <p class="fst-italic">
              Probability and statistics are branches of mathematics that deal
              with uncertainty and data analysis. Probability focuses on the
              likelihood of events occurring, while statistics involves
              collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data to make informed
              decisions and predictions. Together, they provide essential tools
              for understanding and navigating uncertainty in various fields.
